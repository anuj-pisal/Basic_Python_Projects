# 🐍 Basic Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Python projects to demonstrate concepts in data science, GUI development, file handling, OOP, and game logic.

## 📂 Projects Included

---

### 1. 📊 Data Mining Tool (GUI-based)

A simplified data mining tool built with `Tkinter` that supports:

- 📁 **Loading ARFF files**  
- 🔍 **K-Means Clustering** (2 features and `k` clusters with centroid plotting)  
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classification** with accuracy report and tree image export  
- 🧠 Encodes categorical features using LabelEncoder  
- 📈 Visualizes clustering & saves decision tree as `decision_tree.png`

> **Libraries Used**: `Tkinter`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, `Scipy`, `ARFF`

### 2. 📚 Library Management System (Console-based)

A console-based system to simulate basic library operations:

- 📚 View available books  
- 📖 Borrow a book  
- 📥 Return a book  

> **Concepts Used**: Object-Oriented Programming, Lists, Conditionals, Input handling

---

### 3. 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A fun number guessing game where:

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100  
- You keep guessing until you find the correct number  
- Tracks number of guesses and compares with a saved high score (`hiscore.txt`)

> **Concepts Used**: Random number generation, Loops, File I/O

---

### 4. 🧾 Resume Builder (Console-based)

A Python script to dynamically generate a resume based on user input.

- Uses color-coded output for clarity (works best in terminals that support ANSI colors)
- Supports:
  - Education and higher studies
  - Internships and experience
  - Certifications and personal profile
- Prints a formatted resume to the console

> **Concepts Used**: OOP, Conditional branching, ANSI color codes
